1.  Introduction

   The Alternate Marking [RFC9341] and Multipoint Alternate Marking
   [RFC9342] define the Alternate Marking technique that is a hybrid
   performance measurement method, per [RFC7799] classification of
   measurement methods.  This method is based on marking consecutive
   batches of packets and it can be used to measure packet loss,
   latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   The first experiments on Alternate-Marking are described in [RFC8321]
   and [RFC8889].

   According to the definitions of [RFC7799], the Alternate-Marking
   Method can be classified as Hybrid Type I.  Indeed, Alternate Marking
   can be implemented by using reserved bits in the protocol header, and
   the change in value of these marking bits at the source node is
   formally considered a modification of the stream of interest.

   This document complements [RFC9341] and [RFC9342] as it explains the
   mechanisms that can be used to manage and deploy the method.

2.  Alternate Marking Deployment Domain

   The Alternate Marking Method MUST be deployed in a controlled domain
   for security and compatibility reasons.  In this regard, [RFC8799]
   reports further examples of specific limited domain solutions.  It is
   not common that the user traffic originates and terminates within the
   controlled domain.  For this reason, it will typically only be
   applicable in an overlay network, where user traffic is encapsulated
   at one domain border, decapsulated at the other domain border and the
   encapsulation incorporates the relevant extension header for
   Alternate Marking.  This requirement also implies that an
   implementation MUST filter packets that carry Alternate Marking data
   and are entering or leaving the controlled domain.

   A controlled domain is a managed network where it is required to
   select, monitor and control the access to the network by enforcing
   policies at the domain boundaries in order to discard undesired
   external packets entering the domain and check the internal packets
   leaving the domain.  It does not necessarily mean that a controlled
   domain is a single administrative domain or a single organization.  A
   controlled domain can correspond to a single administrative domain or
   can be composed by multiple administrative domains under a defined
   network management.  Indeed, some scenarios may imply that the
   Alternate Marking Method involves more than one domain, but in these
   cases, it is RECOMMENDED that the multiple domains create a whole
   controlled domain while traversing the external domain by employing
   IPsec authentication and encryption or other VPN technology that
   provides full packet confidentiality and integrity protection.  In a
   few words, it must be possible to control the domain boundaries and
   eventually use specific precautions if the traffic traverse the
   Internet.

   The Alternate Marking measurement domain can overlap with the
   controlled domain or may be a subset of the controlled domain.  The
   typical scenarios for the application of the Alternate Marking Method
   depend on the controlled domain boundaries, in particular:

      the user equipment can be the starting or ending node, only in
      case it is fully managed and if it belongs to the controlled
      domain.  In this case the user generated packets contain the
      Alternate Marking data.  But, in practice, this is not common due
      to the fact that the user equipment cannot be totally secured in
      the majority of cases.

      the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) or the PE (Provider Edge)
      routers are most likely to be the starting or ending nodes since
      they can be border routers of the controlled domain.  For
      instance, the CPE, which connects the user's premises with the



Fioccola, et al.          Expires 28 March 2024                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         enhanced-alternate-marking         September 2023


      service provider's network, belongs to a controlled domain only if
      it is managed by the service provider and if additional security
      measures are taken to keep it trustworthy.  Typically the CPE or
      the PE can encapsulate a received packet in an outer header which
      contains the Alternate Marking data.  They can also be able to
      filter and drop packets from outside of the domain with
      inconsistent fields to make effective the relevant security rules
      at the domain boundaries, for example a simple security check can
      be to insert the Alternate Marking data if and only if the
      destination is within the controlled domain.

3.  Alternate Marking Measurement Nodes

   An Alternate-Marking Domain consists of marking nodes, unmarking
   nodes, and transit nodes.

      A marking node, also called encapsulating node, incorporates the
      AltMark Data Fields into packets in order to enable Alternate-
      Marking.  If the Alternate-Marking method is enabled for a
      selected flow of the traffic, the encapsulating node is
      responsible for applying the AltMark functionality to the selected
      flow and to take initial timestamps and packet counters.

      A transit node only reads AltMark Data Fields in order to take
      timestamps and packet counters.

      An unmarking node, also called decapsulating node, reads AltMark
      Data Fields in order to take final timestamps and packet counters
      and then removes any AltMark Option from packets.

4.  Type of Measurements

   The methodology described in the previous sections can be applied to
   various performance measurement problems.  The only requirement is to
   select and mark the flow to be monitored; in this way, packets are
   batched by the sender, and each batch is alternately marked such that
   it can be easily recognized by the receiver.

   Either one or two flag bits might be available for marking in
   different deployments:

      One flag: packet loss measurement MUST be done as described in
      Section 3.1 of [RFC9341], while delay measurement MUST be done
      according to the single-marking method described in Section 3.2.1
      of [RFC9341].  Mean delay (Section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC9341]) MAY also
      be used but it could imply more computational load.

      Two flags: packet loss measurement MUST be done as described in
      Section 3.1 of [RFC9341], while delay measurement MUST be done
      according to double-marking method Section 3.2.2 of [RFC9341].  In
      this case single-marking MAY also be used in combination with
      double-marking and the two approaches provide slightly different
      pieces of information that can be combined to have a more robust
      data set.

   There are some operational guidelines to consider for the purpose of
   deciding to follow the recommendations above and use one or two
   flags.

      The Alternate-Marking method utilizes specific flags in the packet
      header, so an important factor is the number of flags available
      for the implementation.  Indeed, if there is only one flag
      available there is no other way, while if two flags are available
      the option with two flags is certainly more complete.

      The duration of the Alternate-Marking period affects the frequency
      of the measurement and this is a parameter that can be decided on
      the basis of the required temporal sampling.  But it cannot be
      freely chosen, as explained in Section 5 of [RFC9341].

      The Alternate-Marking methodologies enable packet loss, delay and
      delay variation calculation, but in accordance with the method
      used (e.g. single-marking or double-marking), there is different
      kind of information that can be derived.  For example, to get more
      statistics of extent data, the option with two flags is desirable.
      For this reason, the type of data needed in the specific scenario
      is an additional element to take into account.




Fioccola, et al.          Expires 28 March 2024                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         enhanced-alternate-marking         September 2023


      The Alternate-Marking methods imply different computational load
      depending on the method employed.  Therefore, the available
      computational resources on the measurement points can also
      influence the choice.  As an example, mean delay calculation may
      require more processing and it may not be the best option to
      minimize the computational load.

   A deployment of the Alternate-Marking Method should also take into
   account how to handle and recognize marked and unmarked traffic.
   Since Alternate-Marking normally employs a marking field which is
   dedicated, reserved, and included in a protocol extension, the
   measurement points can learn whether the measurement is activated or
   not by checking if the specific extension is included or not within
   the packets.

5.  Manageability

   The YANG model can be used for configuring Alternate-Marking in
   network nodes that support it.  An example is defined in
   [I-D.wang-ippm-alt-mark-yang].

   There are also other control plane mechanisms to advertise and
   activate AltMark capabilities, using PCEP or BGP:
   [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-ifit], [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ifit-capabilities],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-ifit].

   These mechanisms can be used to signal and configure the parameters
   to identify the flow to monitor both in case of point-to-point flow
   and multipoint-to-multipoint flow.  Indeed, the selection of the
   identification fields directly affects the type of paths that the
   flow would follow in the network.  As an example, for IPv6 the
   setting of the Flow Monitoring Identification (FlowMonID) is used in
   combination with source and destination addresses to identify a flow,
   as described in Section 5.3 of [RFC9343], and it can be
   algorithmically generated by the source node or assigned by the
   central controller.

   Additionally, other parameters are essential for the activation of
   the AltMark methodology: the choice between end-to-end or hop-by-hop
   measurement, the choice between the methods with one flag or two
   flags and the duration of the Alternate-Marking period which affects
   the measurement frequency (longer the duration of the block, the less
   frequently the measurement can be taken).

6.  Data Export and Collection

   Each packet marked for Alternate-Marking, as for example the AltMark
   IPv6 option type defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC9343] or the Segment
   Routing TLV Type as defined in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark] MUST be copied to the IPFIX or YANG
   push metering process depending which Network Telemetry [RFC9232]
   protocol is used to export the data.

6.1.  IPFIX

   For IPFIX [RFC7011], the data decomposition can be achieved on the
   Alternate-Marking-aware node exporting the data or on the data
   collection.  When decomposed at the data collection, the headers, as
   example the IPv6 options type header described in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC9343] or the Segment Routing header TLV as described in
   Section 3.1 of [I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark] containing the
   FlowMonID, Loss and Delay flag are being exposed as part of
   ipPayloadPacketSection(IE314), defined in Section 4.2 of RFC 7133.
   When being decomposed on the Alternate-Marking-aware node, new IPFIX
   entities for FlowMonID, Loss and Delay flag are needed so that the
   data can now be aggregated according to section 5 of [RFC7015].
   FlowMonID is a Flow Key field.  The following IPFIX entities are of
   interest to describe the relationship to the forwarding topology and
   the control-plane.

   *  node id, ingressInterface(IE10) and egressInterface(IE14)
      describes on which node which logical ingress and egress
      interfaces have been used to forward the packet.

   *  Node id and egressPhysicalInterface(253) describes on which node
      which physical egress interfaces have been used to forward the
      packet.

   *  Node id and ipNextHopIPv4Address(IE15) or
      ipNextHopIPv6Address(IE62), describes the forwarding path to which
      next-hop IP address.

   *  Node id and mplsTopLabelIPv4Address(IE47) or srhActiveSegmentIPv6
      from [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-srv6-srh] describes the forwarding
      path to which MPLS top label IPv4 address or SRv6 active segment.

   *  BGP communities are often used for setting a path priority or
      service selection. bgpDestinationExtendedCommunityList(488) or
      bgpDestinationCommunityList(485) or
      bgpDestinationLargeCommunityList(491) describes which group of
      prefixes have been used to forward the packet.

   *  Node id and destinationIPv4Address(13),
      destinationTransportPort(11), protocolIdentifier (4) and
      sourceIPv4Address(IE8) describes the forwarding path on each node
      from each IPv4 source address to a specific application in the
      network.

   To calculate loss, the packet count with octetDeltaCount(IE1) and to
   calculate delay, either flowStartSeconds(IE150),
   flowStartMilliseconds(IE152), flowStartMicroseconds(IE154) or
   flowStartNanoseconds(IE156), depending on timestamp granularity
   requirements, are needed.

   To calculate loss, the packet count with octetDeltaCount(IE1) and to
   calculate delay, either flowStartSeconds(IE150),
   flowStartMilliseconds(IE152), flowStartMicroseconds(IE154) or
   flowStartNanoseconds(IE156), depending on timestamp granularity
   requirements, are needed.

6.2.  YANG Push

   For YANG Push [RFC8639], periodical subscription as defined in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC8641] is used to subscribe data.  Decomposition is
   done on the Alternate-Marking-aware node publishing the data.  The
   YANG module contains FlowMonID as key, Loss and Delay flag, ingress
   and egress interface ifIndex [RFC2863], octet delta count describing
   the amount of observed packets within a flow to measure loss, and

   flow start timestamp describing the first packet observed for
   measuring delay as leafes.

   Since the amount of observed data could overwhelm a route processor
   on a network node, publishing data from network processors as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-netconf-distributed-notif] is advised.

7.  Encapsulations

7.1.  IPv6

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for IPv6 is defined in [RFC9343],
   which also discusses deployment considerations for IPv6 networks.

   The IPv6 AltMark Option [RFC9343] applies the Alternate Marking
   Method to IPv6, and defines an Extension Header Option to encode the
   Alternate Marking Method for both the Hop-by-Hop Options Header and
   the Destination Options Header.

7.2.  SRv6

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for SRv6 is discussed in IPv6 AltMark
   Option [RFC9343] and [I-D.fz-spring-srv6-alt-mark].

7.3.  BIER

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for BIER is introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-pmmm-oam].

7.4.  MPLS

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for MPLS is introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sfl].

7.5.  SFC

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for SFC is introduced in
   [I-D.mfm-ippm-sfc-nsh-pmamm].

7.6.  NVO3

   Alternate-Marking encapsulation for NVO3 is introduced in
   [I-D.fmm-nvo3-pm-alt-mark].

7.7.  Enhanced capabilities

   [I-D.zhou-ippm-enhanced-alternate-marking] defines extended data
   fields for the AltMark Option and provides enhanced capabilities to
   overcome some challenges and enable future proof applications.

   It is worth mentioning that the enhanced capabilities are intended
   for further use and are optional.

8.  Implementation Considerations

   In a controlled domain, the nodes may support the AltMark specific
   encapsulation and this also depends on the implementation.  If a node
   is configured to read the AltMark option, the measurement is done on
   that node, otherwise it is simply not considered in the measurement.

   Assuming that the measurement domain overlaps with the controlled
   domain, the procedure for AltMark data encapsulation can be
   summarized as follows:

   *  Ingress Node: the Ingress Node of a controlled domain that
      supports the Alternate Marking Method adds the AltMark data in the
      the data packets.

   *  Intermediate Node: if an Intermediate Node is not capable of
      processing the AltMark data, it simply ignores it.  If an
      Intermediate Node is capable of processing the AltMark data, it
      processes it.

   *  Egress SR Node: The Egress Node is the last node of the controlled
      domain.  The processing if the AltMark data is similar to the
      processing at the Intermediate Nodes.  The only difference is that
      it needs to remove the AltMark data from the the data packets.

9.  Security Considerations

   Alternate Marking [RFC9341] and Multipoint Alternate Marking
   [RFC9342] analyze different security concerns and related solutions.
   These aspects are valid and applicable also to this document.  In
   particular the fundamental security requirement is that Alternate
   Marking MUST only be applied in a specific limited domain, as also
   mentioned in [RFC8799].

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request to IANA.
